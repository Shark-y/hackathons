Root folder for NCSU Quantumn Club Hackathons

The Quantum Information Club at NC State is a community of students interested in learning about and developing a skillset in quantum information and computing. Quantum computing can be a difficult field to start in, so the club is designed to break down the barriers to entry by providing members with a collaborative learning environment and opportunities to learn quantum programming with hands-on workshops and hackathons. We also work closely with industry and university partners like Duke and UNC Chapel-Hill to expand the scope of research, learning, and professional development opportunities for all members.
